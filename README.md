### Project Overview
This project analyzes employee data to understand the distribution across teams, position prevalence, age demographics, salary expenditures, and the correlation between age and salary within an organization. The insights derived from this analysis aim to guide management in making informed decisions regarding workforce strategies, hiring, and resource allocation.
